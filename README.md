minor project using netbeans IDE on suggesting movies

This project is for those who are in confusion which movies they should watch like us. So here we comes up with a solution to suggest a random movie from a list of movies according to the choice specified by the user.


This project uses mysql database in order to track record of movies and respond to the request of the user effectively.
